# My-personal-portfolio description
This space offers a curated glimpse into who I am-my passions, academic background, interests, and the projects I've had the pleasure of working on. It serves not only as a reflection of my journey so far, but also as a showcase of all the skills and experiences I’ve acquired along the way.  You’ll also find a copy of my CV to complement the content. 

**Brief overview of my portfolio**
I made use of HTML programmng language to structure my page and help layout my porfolio content in sections. CSS was used to help style and add a bit of animation to portfolio to make it visually appealing and engaging. And javascript was utilised to handle form submission and scroll animation.

**Elements used and why they were used**
HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
<!DOCTYPE html> — Declares the document type as HTML5.
<html lang="en"> — Starts the HTML document and sets the language to English.
<head> — Contains metadata (like the title, character encoding, and styles).
<body> — Contains the visible content (text, sections, images, form, etc.).
<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer> — Semantic tags to organize the page clearly.
<section> — Groups related content (like About, Experience, etc.).
<form> — Used to gather user feedback.
<a>, <ul>, <li>, <h1>, <p>, <img>, etc. — Elements for layout, navigation, and content.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
<style> inside <head> — Holds your internal CSS rules.
body — Styled with a green gradient background and animation.
@keyframes fadeIn / pulse — Smooth fade-in and pulsing animation effects.
.profile-img, .cv-link, nav ul, section, button, etc. — Styled with fonts, colors, spacing, hover effects, transitions.

JavaScript (JS)
Added in the <script> tag at the bottom of the page.
Handles the scroll animation (slide-in class toggle — though not fully implemented here).
Handles the feedback form submission:
-Captures name + message
-Displays it in real-time
-Fades the message after 5 seconds
